You are part of an IT team tasked with securing a number of ubuntu servers. The previous IT team had very poor security... They failed to set up any firewalls and they had horrible default passwords.

Your servers can be found at... 

10.0.12.21
10.0.2.94
10.0.46.69
10.0.35.11
10.0.36.67

as well as five other machines on the subnet 10.0.0.0/17 whose IPs your boss has lost.

The usernames you've been given are:
blah
void
caprica
libre
figure_six
pizza_9
green_5

and they all have the same default passwords, which your instructor will provide to you.

Your tasks are simple:
1. Change the default passwords, consider whether all users should have administrative privileges
2. Set up firewall rulesets for all machines, that only allow connections to the services running (such as a web sever or DNS server), as well as ssh (careful not to lock yourselves out)
3. Find the missing machines and do the same.
4. Coordinate with your other team members so you don't step on. This will involve figuring how who else is playing, and how to communicate passwords and such.
